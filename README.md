## About

The plugin is native to 1.21. I have no clue if it supports any other versions.

This plugin allows server owners to customize the cooldown times for certain Minecraft items.

Note that this is my first Java Plugin release, and while it's small and simple, I am confident there are no issues. However, feel free to let me know if you have a suggestion or run into any issues.

## Configuration

The plugin's cooldowns are controlled via the `config.yml` file. Adjust the values as needed. Hopefully they are self explanitory.

```yaml
# The values are in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
EnderPearlCooldown: 0
WindChargeCooldown: 0
GoatHornCooldown: 0
```

# Installation
1. Download the plugin jar file from the SpigotMC page https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cooldown.118931/
2. Place the jar file in your server's plugins folder
3. Restart your server
4. Edit the config.yml to your liking and reload the server

# Support
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please use the discussions tab on SpigotMc or open an issue here on GitHub.
